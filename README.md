# Basic Machine Learning

This project is used to test and learn about different machine learning models and concepts. Only supervised learning has been implemented thus far, classifying handwritten digits.

### Tools
[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is used for the project, where additional packages such as [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) and [numpy](https://numpy.org/) are imported.
